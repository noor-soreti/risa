/*

state: 
    - state is READ-ONLY in Redux
    - in order to make a change to state we need to dispatch an action

action: 
    - describes what changes we want to make in state
    - actions are consumed by reducers

reducer:
    - a reducer accepts two things: (1) action and (2) state then returns new updated instance of state
    - *NOTE* reducers do not change state, they produce a new instance of state with necessary updates
        - *WHY?* makes state management predictable

configureStore:
    - standard method for creating Redux *store* -> core object that holds state tree of application
